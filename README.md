# Algebraic Functions Package

## Included Functions:
- Linear Function:
<p>
    This function represents a linear equation in the form y = mx + b, 
    where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Given the values of x, m, and b, 
    the function calculates and returns the corresponding y value.
</p>

- Quadratic Function:
<p>
    This function represents a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. 
    iven the values of x, a, b, and c, the function calculates and returns 
    the corresponding y value.
</p>

- Absolute Value Function:
<p>
    This function calculates the absolute value of a number x. 
    The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, 
    always resulting in a non-negative value.
</p>

- Square Root Function:
<p>
    This function uses the sqrt function from the math module to calculate 
    the square root of a given number x. The result is the positive square root of x.
</p>

- Exponential Function:
<p>
    This function calculates the result of an exponential expression where x is 
    the exponent and base is the base of the exponentiation. 
    It uses the exp function to raise base to the power of x.
